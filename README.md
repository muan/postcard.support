> We don't need to write anything, not really. "Thinking of you" is the single thing that the majority of the posted cards say.

Here is a collection of guides for sending postcards from different countries if you were to find yourself in the foreign country, thinking of someone.

I love postcards and I love the idea of being thought of by a friend some time in the past unbeknownst to me. Equally, I want to let my friends know that even though they were not with me, and I didn't necessarily wish that they were there with me, they simply had been on my mind.

I want more people to be keeping a rollodex of their friends' addresses and writing postcards on a whim.

I suggest to always put date, time, and location as you sign your postcards, and take a photo of it before mailing for your own recollection.

### Means

#### Stamps

Find a post office (郵局 or 中華郵政), get a number for the queue, go to the counter when your number shows on the screen, and purchase stamps. There is usually a dedicated English service counter. Language should not be a problem. Just show them the written cards with country clearly spelt out.

The convenience stores (7-11 and such) "sell" stamps but it really depends on if the clerk you meet can be bothered and if they are experienced enough. A lot more talking is involved, but if you're desparate given post offices' limited opening times, it's worth trying.

#### Pricing

As of 2024, the postage from domestic to international postcards ranges from 5 NTD (domestic) to 12 NTD (EU, south America) per. If you are unsure, just put 12 NTD stamp or slightly higher. You can obviously also combine stamps of different values.

#### Mailing

- Post offices
- Postboxes should not be hard to find on the street. They are red and green. Domestic mails go into the green one and international mails the red.

### Means

#### Stamps

You should be able to get stamps in any of the stores and post offices listed on [posturinn.is](https://posturinn.is/en/individuals/sending/stamps/). Most people in Iceland speak excellent english so you shouldn't have any issues (given you speak english of course).

The Icelandic post office has been steadily reducing the amount of postboxes so it might be tricky finding a postbox. Luckily [their website maintaines a list of postboxes and their location](https://posturinn.is/einstaklingar/ymsar-upplysingar/postnumer-og-thjonustustig/#tab=2).

#### Stamps

Find a post office (Česká pošta or just pošta), get a number for the
queue. You should choose what you send on the touch screen. (dopis = a
letter). Go to the counter when your number shows on the screen, and
purchase stamps. People in post offices barely speak English, but if
you show them the written cards with country clearly spelt out, it
should be OK.

The illustration of stamps varies depending on people in post offices.
They have a big file of stamps and they choose stamps from them.
(Sometimes you can choose, but they don’t have all kinds of stamps.)

If you want fancy stamps with illustrations in Prague, go to the
Hlavní pošta (which means Main post office, address Jindřišská 14, 110
00, Nové Město, Praha 1.) After entering in the building, you will
find the stamp store corner (one window) on your left. (In the corner
of the building.) You will find stamps with Czech illustrators etc.
