> We don't need to write anything, not really. "Thinking of you" is the single thing that the majority of the posted cards say.

Here is a collection of guides for sending postcards from different countries if you were to find yourself in the foreign country, thinking of someone.

I love postcards and I love the idea of being thought of by a friend, some time in the past unbeknownst to me. Equally, I want to let my friends know that even though they were not with me, and I didn't necessarily wish them were there with me, they had been on my mind.

I want more people to be keeping a rollodex of your friends addresses and writing postcards on a whim.

I suggest to always put date, time, and location as you sign your postcards.

### Means

#### Stamps

Find a post office (郵局 or 中華郵政), get a number for the queue, go to the counter when your number shows on the screen, and purchase stamps. Language should not be a problem. Just show them the written cards with country clearly spelt out.

The convenience stores (7-11 and such) "sell" stamps but it really depends on if the clerk you meet can be bothered and if they are experienced enough. A lot more talking is involved, but if you're desparate given post offices' limited opening times, it's worth trying.

#### Pricing

As of 2024, the postage from domestic to international postcards ranges from 5 NTD (domestic) to 12 NTD (EU, south Anerica) per.

#### Mailing

- Post offices
- Postboxes should not be hard to find on the street. They are red and green. Domestic mails go into the green one and international mails the red.
